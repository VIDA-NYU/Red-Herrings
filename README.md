# Red Herrings
Git repository for [&lt;/humantrafficking> hackathon](https://ehthackathon.splashthat.com/) presented by Cornell Tech and the New York County District Attorney's office.

# Challenge question

How might we use open data to discover red flags that identify labour traffickers?

# Solution

1. Collect: Build a data aggregator
2. Process: Use machine learning to extract useful red flags from the rich data produced by 1.
3. Display: Display (1) the raw data to allow an analyst to deduce patterns in the data; (2) highlight discrepancies learned from 2.
